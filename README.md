# Cpp
C++
This is just some kode i practiced memorizing syntax for an exame because we write our code on paper on the examse and dont have much
syntax we can look up during the exam. 
All the classes is one task each and what i uploaded on git is a bit of the core functionallity of C++ such as 
pointers and smart pointers, operation overriding, bit manipulation and so on.

(i didnt use header in some of the task beacuse of the format the task was given)
